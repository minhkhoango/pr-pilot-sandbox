Hi, thank you for checking out the sandbox.

This repo serves to show my simple GitHub action in action. 
Make ANY edits through GitHub's UI, fork, and make a PR to pr-pilot-sandbox. After ~12 seconds, you will see a post in Markdown format, generated by the fast and careless Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite.

If you find this GitHub action valuable, a waste of time, or hate how I sound like an LLM bot, email me back! I truly appreciate all feedback.
